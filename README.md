# BIOS694_Final_Project
This is the final project of course BIOS694 from McGill, which aims to critically summarize, review and replicate the results in the paper.
In BIOS694_Final_Project repository, there is a dataset called file2754771351f4.arff which is the Yeast dataset used to do the replication.
I have also attached the original paper here for easier access.
Also, there is a PDF called results_comparison that has two tables which aims compare the multi-label classification results (Table3) in the paper and my own replication results.
Finally, the replication R file is uploaded.

For reproducibility, please download the .arff dataset and replace your own path to the dataset and run the whole code, then it should give you the results shown in the results_comparison PDF.
